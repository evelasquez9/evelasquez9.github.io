            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is Ezekiel Velasquez. I am a first year studying Computer Science and so far college has been a very different and interesting 
            experience. I've met and made many new friendships in my couple of weeks here at URI and it's amazing. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me!</p>
